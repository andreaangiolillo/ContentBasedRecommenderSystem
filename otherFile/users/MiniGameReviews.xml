@GAMEdigital Thanks. Q2. How do I know if I was within the first 10,000, the store said, I would get an email, but got nothing yet.

#GuildWars2 #HoT Beta, the graphics do LOOK very impressive. I mean... WOW..
First Impressions of the BETA for #GuildWars2 #Hot is that you can't join friends on another map, which is disappointing for now...
Looking forward to the Beta for #HeartOfThorns but at the moment, I have the email but no Beta charater slot. @GuildWars2 is this normal?
Anyone else a little excited for the #guildwars2 #heartofthorns beta today? I know I am .
So far, I LOVE #TheWitcher3 game, one of the best games I have ever playing, the worst part is I have to stop playing for real life things.
So anyone got gamign plans for this weekend? Or are you all just waiting for the #Witcher3WildHunt?
Did a couple of #destinythegame #CrotasEnd raids last night with some friends, it was good fun. Got some nice loot.
On May 19th I have a gaming crisis. Both #destinythegame #HouseofWolves and #TheWitcher3WildHunt are out and there is only one of me. Ideas?
Still like to get a #guildwars2 #HoT Beta stone, doesn't look like I will get one. Guess that means I have less to write... #LessWorkForMe
I must admit to have been playing a lot more #destinythegame that I perhaps should have, but the mroe I play the more relaxing it seems.
Sorry for the lack of reviews recently, we have had a lot of of things going on. We are still around, and we will get back on track.
How to get Beta access for #Hot #GuildWars2 https://t.co/OOyPxfWsKe interesting idea using in game #RNG but it could go horribly wrong.
